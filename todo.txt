#################   MAIN APP TODOS
########################################################################################################################

####  basic UI friendliness
- utilize `clickpos1` more like a selector

####  basic error handling / edge cases / expanding configurables
- better defaults / init for `modelData`
- connect the `modelData.feature` (or just `modelData` in general), table in gui, and conf.selectedFeatures
- make `modelData.centers` configurable to more than '30';

####  holes in functionality (code defensiveness?)
- at gui start, pre-make (if nec) all `data/` dir structure

####  housekeeping / tech-debt
- detect class from modelClassifierFile to get conf.classifier

####  emotion todo:
angry & neutral testing, verbal vs. nonverbal?


####  paper - latex, university template file - look online
table of contents

chapter 1 - intro
highlight importance

chapter 2 - related work
- general stuff about audio features (similar to shuangs 'related work')
- section that describes shuangs
- differences / similarities   - comparison

chapter 3 - my work

check last day to submit thesis, work backwards
defend 3 or 4 days before that
10-14 weeks have thesis ready
before that, figure out committee stuff

Hello Dr. Calhoun, my name is Justin Taylor, and I'm a CS graduate student working on a Masters thesis on an extension to Shuang Jiang's dissertation on speech data analysis of audio/video of doctor/patient simulations.  His dissertation (which he defended a couple years ago May 2015) included an apparatus to analyze conversations between doctors and clients, including speaker identification, silence detection, and emotion classification.  My extension has focused on duplicating some of the speaker identification features, as well as deeper focus on the emotion detection.

It is my understanding that you had helped in part by providing video (perhaps DVD or raw video files) of these simulated engagements (I think using actors).  I'm approaching the light at the end of the tunnel on my work on this, and am wondering if you happen to have some raw video data (e.g. DVD, .avi, etc) for me to use - in particular where there are one or more actors that appear in multiple videos.  If that can't be found, any available, original video would still be useful for me.  Perhaps 10 or so complete videos would be fine if available.

I have no problem stopping by your office to pick up the copies.  Thanks so much!

Apply machine learning systems to the existing, manual review process.  In particular, 






The Simulation for Pediatric Assessment, Resuscitation, and Communication (SPARC) Program is a multidisciplinary, simulation-based educational program based at Kosair Children’s Hospital. Simulation based educational methodologies are the primary vehicle for SPARC’s mission to ultimately improve the care of children. Among the goals of SPARC is the strengthening of clinician-patient interactions. This is often done by manually analyzing and assessing video simulations of such engagements which is then translated into an instruction or a course of action that is designed to improve subsequent engagements, thus improving the overall care for children. As the amount of simulation data increases, the amount of time needed for review increases. Without tools to expedite the analysis, a significant amount of the reviewers time is consumed in the review process.




The Simulation for Pediatric Assessment, Resuscitation, and Communication (SPARC) Program is a multidisciplinary simulation-based educational program based at Kosair Children’s Hospital.  A primary focus of SPARC is Crisis Resource Management training, which is focused on the teamwork and communication skills needed to successfully manage a pediatric medical crisis.  These training sessions typically focus on team organization, team communication, and common errors.  Video recordings of each simulation are kept and archived for educational and quality improvement purposes.  The SPARC program, at its inception, was proposed to the IRB and declared exempt (Protocol 07.0068)
	One type of error that occurs during medical crises with alarming frequency revolves around the issues with the medical hierarchy.  Specifically, this type of error occurs when a team member is asked by a team leader to perform some action which they know or suspect is incorrect.  Despite this misgiving, the action is often carried out anyway due to the authority invested in the leader.  This can lead to significant patient morbidity.  Because of this, the SPARC program crafted a simulated situation designed to highlight this issue.  We utilized this scenario three times between December of 2008 and June of 2009 with excellent results.  After retrospectively reviewing the scenario, the SPARC team is preparing to publish it and wishes to obtain approval for the use of de-identified descriptions of two instances of the scenario as it played out in practice.

To retrospectively analyze 2 instances of the scenario noted above videotaped during sessions of the SPARC Crisis Resource Management Program for the purposes of providing de-identified descriptions of potential outcomes of the scenario’s use when the scenario is published



The objective is to apply machine learning algorithms to improve software tools that assist in the analysis and assessment of clinician-patent interaction simulations.  In particular, speaker recognition and emotion detection are among the primary focuses of this project.





We intend to use any existing simulation data to train and test our software.
